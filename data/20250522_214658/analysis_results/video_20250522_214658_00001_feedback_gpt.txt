Feedback: 
The generated video included objects such as cars, motorcycles, a person, and a teddy bear, but did not feature a camera, city, new, panda, street, york, or zoom as specified in the prompt. To better align the video with your intentions, consider providing more specific details or descriptions of the missing objects. For example, you could include phrases like "capture a bustling city street in New York through a zoom lens, focusing on a panda riding a motorcycle." This additional context can help the AI generate a video that more closely matches your desired outcome.
