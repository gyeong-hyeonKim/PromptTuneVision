Feedback: 
The video generated for the prompt did not include the objects "forest" and "sunset" as specified in the prompt. The video did include a bird and a dog, which were not mentioned in the original prompt. To improve the match between the prompt and the generated video, you may consider providing more specific details or focusing on the key elements you want to see in the video. For example, you could mention the type of forest (e.g., dense pine forest) and describe the sunset scene (e.g., vibrant colors reflecting off the water). This will help the AI better understand your desired outcome and generate a more accurate video.
